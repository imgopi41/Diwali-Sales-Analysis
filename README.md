**I. Descirption**

This is simple Diwali Sales Project implemented by using different libraries in Python.

In this project I have Analyzed the data by using "Pandas" & "Numpy", And shown it into 

Graphical format by using Visualization tools like "Seaborn", & "Matplotlib".


**II. Technology Stack**

Language: Python

IDE used: Jupyter Notebook



**III. Objective**

1. Improve customer experience by analyzing sales data.
 
2. Increase Revenue

**Questions**

Q1. Remove all the Null values from the given dataset. 

Q2. Plot a Bar Chart on Gender and it's Count.

Q3. Plot a Bar Chart on Gender and Total Amount.

Q4. Plot Bar Chart on Age Group of both Male & Female. And also show the Sales by the Age-Groups.

Q5. Shown the Sales done by all the Age-Groups.

Q6. Plot a Graph on Total number of Orders by Top 10 States. 

Q7. Plot a Graph chart of Total Amount or Sales from Top 10 States.

Q8. Show the Marital Status by using Bar Chart.

Q9. Show the Sales by using Marital Status.

Q10. Show the Graph of which Occupation holders made highest Number Sales.

Q11. Show the Graph of products which made highest sales by category.

Q12. Show the Top 10 Sold Products. 


**IV. Things i have Worked on:**

Libraries used in Python

1. Pandas

2. Numpy

3. Matplotlib

4. Seaborn


**V. Work-Flow**

1. Project is implemented by using different libraries like "Pandas", "Numpy", "Matplotlib" and "Seaborn".
 
2. This project is completely focused on visualizing the data.

3. Diwali sales dataset was read from CSV file and the complete project is exceuted in Jupyter Notebook.

4. Graphs are plotted on Married Women, All the Age-Groups of both Female & Male. Shown Top 10 States, 
  Which Working sector made Highest sales in buying products like Food, Clothing and Electronic Category.

**VII. Applications & Future enhancements:**

This is an Interactive reports on Diwali Sales. This is completely Beginners and Intermediate project
The one who is cures to be part of Data Analysis this is absolutely for those who are likely want to learn python for Data Analysis.
I have mainly Focused on Visualization tools in this project to show my skills that I have gained in "Data Visualization using Python" Course from IBM.
